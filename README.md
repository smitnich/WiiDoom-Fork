# WiiDoom-Fork
Neither the original game or the  Wii port were my original work, but I have updated controls, introduced new control schemes,
improved interfaces, and fixed long-standing bugs.

Controls

Now supports the following input methods:<ul>
<li>Wii Remote with Nunchuck</li>
<li>Gamecube controller</li>
<li>USB Keyboard</li>
<li>USB Mouse</li>
<li>Classic controller</li>
</ul>
Music

Music can be played, but an SD card is required to do so. (External hard drives will not work due to seek time causing massive slowdown in game). In order to do so, extract the contents of this folder to your SD card<br>

(These were created by the FreePats Project: http://freepats.zenvoid.org/)

Savegames

Differing IWADS have seperate folders for save games now; for example DOOM2 savegames will be in savegames/doom2. This is done to prevent loading savegames of the wrong game. If you want to copy over saves from an older version, just stick them in the proper folder.

Wii U

UStealth is supported for external FAT32 drives. Wii U Pro Controller support is planned but not currently implemented.
